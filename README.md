Repository for version control of data science related personal projects. The goal of this project is to improve my personal portfolio while learning new techniques and concepts on Data Science.

# Mask detection
It is a project that uses computer vision to identify in video is a person is wearing a facil mask or not. This project make use of three main libraries: 
- __[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):__ to run the video stream and detect when there is one or more faces in the frame;
- __[imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils):__ to handle image (the video frames) manipulations;
- __[Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/):__ to create, train and predict if the person in the video frame is wearing a mask.
