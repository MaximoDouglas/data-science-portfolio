It is a project that uses computer vision to identify in video is a person is wearing a facil mask or not. This project make use of three main libraries: 
- __Tensorflow 2.0:__ to create and train the mask detector model;
- __imutils:__ to handle image (the video frames) manipulations;
- __OpenCV:__ to run the video stream and detect when there is one or more faces in the frame.
