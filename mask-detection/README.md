## Mask detection
It is a python application that uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for real-time face mask detection.

## Resources
The 3rd-party resources are already integrated with the application. This is a reference list to find the original artfacts:
- Face detection model and the script to download its weights can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn/face_detector).
- The dataset of people wearing masks can be found [here](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data).
- The tutorial that inspired this project can be found [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/).
